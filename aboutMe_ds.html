		<p>Hi, I’m Praveen, a freelance data scientist with a solid background in software engineering. I specialize in turning data into actionable insights through data visualization and machine learning. As a strong advocate for open-source solutions, I primarily work with Python and R to craft innovative and community-driven data solutions.</p>
		
		<p>I am deeply passionate about exploring the potential of data to solve real-world challenges, and I thrive on uncovering hidden patterns that inspire "aha" moments. Whether it's analyzing trends or building machine learning models, I approach every project with curiosity and precision.</p>

		<h2>Here are some highlights of my work:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Electric Vehicle Data Analysis:</strong> Visualized and analyzed performance metrics and trends in electric vehicles to provide actionable insights.</li>
			<li><strong>Financial Market Data Analysis:</strong> Investigated patterns and trends in financial market data to inform decision-making strategies.</li>
			<li><strong>Synthetic Data Generation:</strong> Developed tools to generate synthetic datasets for diverse machine learning applications.</li>
			<li><strong>DNA Classification:</strong> Applied machine learning techniques to classify DNA sequences, contributing to advancements in healthcare technology.</li>
			<li><strong>Image Colorization:</strong> Leveraged OpenCV and machine learning to transform black-and-white images into vivid, colorized versions.</li>
			<li><strong>Brain Tumor Detection:</strong> Built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for detecting brain tumors from medical imaging.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Outside of work, I’m passionate about endurance sports and healthy living. I’ve enjoyed roles as an ice-skating instructor at Duosport and a swimming coach for aspiring triathletes at Hellas Triathlon. I even skated 200 km with Skate4air to raise funds for Cystic Fibrosis research, an experience that reinforced my belief in using personal passion to contribute to meaningful causes.</p>

		<p>If you have a project at the intersection of data science and sports, healthcare, or sustainability, I’d love to collaborate. Let’s turn your data into impactful solutions!</p>
